Verification-Guraranteed and Safety-Oriented Optimization Frameworks for Learning-Based Congestion Control
A general verification and interpretability framework for deep reinforcement learning, which combines the formal verification of deep neural network with bounded model checking algorithm and k-induction algorithm to verify the properties of deep reinforcement learning or give counterexamples.
